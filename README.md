Build a Financial Calculator
============================

You will be [working on this project with Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zUAVAkwyjat4Z-8nfrajM1ut9UcO18We?usp=sharing).

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

For this challenge, you need to create a financial calculator using Python that take input and do the following:

*   Calculate annuity with monthly or continuous growth
*   Calculate monthly mortgage payment
*   Estimate retirement investment balance
*   Determine how long until an amount doubles, given the rate
*   Solve logarithmic equations
*   Convert to (and from) scientific notation

If you are struggling, you can follow the [video walkthrough for this project.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2AhGd6srJ0)

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
